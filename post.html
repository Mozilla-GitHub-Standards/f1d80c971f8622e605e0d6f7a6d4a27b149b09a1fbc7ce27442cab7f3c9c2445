                    <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-621 postImg" title="contacts-1" src="img/2-mozbuzz-overview.jpg" alt="" height="719" width="600">
                </a>
            </p>
            <p>During a Mozilla Labs week a while back, I was tasked with creating a logo for a yet to be realized project that centered around a person’s contacts.&nbsp; That initial experiment has matured into a full Labs project and is now up and running
                as Mozilla Labs Contacts, so head on over and <a href="https://mozillalabs.com/contacts/">check it out</a>.</p>
            <p>When it comes to the actual logo, whatever possessed me to try and illustrate a field of undulating light in vector is beyond me.&nbsp; I may have been mad at myself for not grabbing a cup of coffee that morning, or perhaps I was keen on having
                a headache that day.&nbsp; Either way, it happened – so I thought I’d share the process.</p>
            <p>First order of business, I illustrated the address book.&nbsp; A fairly straight forward illustration – gradients and strips of color forming the volume of the pages and cover.&nbsp; As always, applying more than one gradient to a shape using
                the Appearance panel within Illustrator is key to getting volume, ambient light and shadows looking the way you want.&nbsp; Layering colors and gradients using different transparency effects is the greatest technique for building anything
                in vector.
            </p>
            <p>Now comes the fun part – projected holographic light!&nbsp; Of course, the line “Help me Obi Wan..” popped into my head as soon as I started and stuck as the main inspiration for the visual.&nbsp; The first step was to create a human shape
                on a similar 3/4 plane as the book.&nbsp; I hunted around for an inspirational image and found a nice classic bust sculpture at the proper angle.&nbsp; The next task was illustrating it with high contrast light and shadow outlines to allow
                a”pass through” look for the 3D light form.&nbsp; A bottom up radial gradient gave the illusion of a light source originating from the book which I then augmented with another full outline of the shape including the beam itself.&nbsp;
                Adding a “Stylize &gt; Feather” effect to the vector shape gave it a nice transparent gaseous look and completed the form.&nbsp; Of course, the whole technology of projected holograms is not yet perfected, so I had to create an overlay
                gradient of wavy lines to convey signal frequency issues.&nbsp; All the needed elements were now complete.&nbsp; Put them together and what have you got?&nbsp; Bippity boppity boo in most cases, but in this case a somewhat believable hologram.</p>
            <p>At some point I may create a video showing the techniques used in the creation of one of my logos.&nbsp; I’ll be sure to see what I can whip up in the form of an instructional video when I can find the time.&nbsp; *presses the laugh track
                button*&nbsp; Seriously, though, I’ll see what I can come up with.</p>
